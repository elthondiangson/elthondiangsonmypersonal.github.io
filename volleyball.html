	On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game 
called Mintonette as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis 
and handball. Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometers) away in the 
city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members 
of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

	The first rules, written down by William G Morgan, called for a net 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) high, a 25 ft × 50 ft (7.6 m × 15.2 m) court, and any 
number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for 
each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered 
a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.

	After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA 
Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: "volley ball"). Volleyball 
rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.

	Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other 
team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964. The complete rules are extensive, but 
simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or 
arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded 
within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches 
are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded
in their court. The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the 
opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball 
to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:

    <li>causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net; </li>
    <li>catching and throwing the ball; </li>
    <li>double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player; </li>
    <li>four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team; </li>
    <li>net foul: touching the net during play; </li>
    <li>foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving. </li>

	The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.
A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical 
jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures.
